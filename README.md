# The book “Principles of Databases”

In this repository, we will be releasing the upcoming book “Principles
of Databases”, by Marcelo Arenas, Pablo Barcelo, Leonid Libkin, Wim Martens, and Andreas Pieris. 
The book will be about the foundational and mathematical
principles of databases in its various forms. 

## The general philosophy of the book

* We planned the book such that large parts of it are suitable for
teaching.  A chapter roughly corresponds to the contents of a single
lecture.

* For the ease of teaching and understanding the material, we may
sometimes cut corners. If we want to give the reader a relatively
quick insight of a particular result, this sometimes means that we
present a weaker form of the result than the most general result known
in the literature.  We have been teaching from this book ourselves,
but the present version will undoubtedly still have errors. If you
find some, you can open an issue on Github and we will look into it.

## Suggestions for improvements

Please let us know if you find any errors in the book, or places that
you find particularly unclear. The new versions of the book, including
corrections, will be published in this repository.

Exercise suggestions are also very welcome. We have generated some
initial ideas for exercises, but we are aware that the exercises for
the currently released parts still needs work. We also plan to
accompany each part with bibliographic remarks.

## Getting a complete copy of the book

Rendering large PDF documents can be problematic on Github. Some browsers
only show the first 250 pages. If you want a full copy of the current 
version of the book, please download the full pdf file.
